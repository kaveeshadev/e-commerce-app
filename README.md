 🌟 Excited to share my latest project: Forever! 🌟

I've developed a full-stack e-commerce platform to enhance my backend and frontend skills. Here’s a quick overview of the tech stack and features:

🖥 Frontend:

React.js and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive user experience.
🔧 Backend:

Node.js and Express.js for a robust server-side application.
MongoDB for efficient data storage.
🔒 Authentication:

Implemented jsonwebtoken and Express.js for secure user authentication.
🛍 Key Features:

Browse and select garments with ease.
Add items to your cart and choose from multiple payment options: COD, Stripe, and Razorpay.
Track your orders to see their status: Shipped, Out for Delivery, or Delivered.
👩‍💼 Admin Panel:

Admins can add, remove, or update products seamlessly.
Change the status of ordered items to keep customers informed.
This project has been an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited to continue developing my skills in full-stack development! 🚀
